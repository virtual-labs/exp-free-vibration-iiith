Start the experiment with some default values of initial displacement (u=10mm) and initial velocity (v=5m/s). and zero damping. Pause the experiment after a few cycles.

**Observation 1:**

1. Observe the time period (T) and amplitude.
2. Again start the experiment freshly, this time modifying the values of initial conditions.
3. Observe that the time period is independent of initial conditions.

**Observation 2:**

1. Effect of structures properties on time period
2. Modify the value of mass and observe the change in time period.
3. Run the experiment for different values of mass and note the time period every time mass is changed
4. Draw the graph between mass and time period.
