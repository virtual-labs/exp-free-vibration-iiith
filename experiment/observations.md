Start the experiment with some default values of initial displacement (u=10mm) and initial velocity (v=5m/s). and zero damping. Pause the experiment after a few cycles.<br>

**Observation 1:**
- Observe the time period (T) and amplitude.
- Again start the experiment freshly, this time modifying the values of initial conditions.
- Observe that the time period is independent of initial conditions.

**Observation 2:**
- Effect of structures properties on time period
- Modify the value of mass and observe the change in time period.
- Run the experiment for different values of mass and note the time period every time mass is changed
- Draw the graph between mass and time period.
