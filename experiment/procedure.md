Start the experiment with some default values of intial displacement, initial velocity, mass and stiffness of the system. Pause the experiment after a few cycles.

**Observation 1:**

- Observe the time period and amplitude.
- Modify the values of inital displacement and inital velocities.
- Observe that the time period is independent of initial conditions

**Observation 2:**

- Modify the value of mass and observe the change in time period.
- Run the experiment for different values of mass and note the time period every time mass
is changed
- Check the graph between mass and time period.
- Repeat the same with stiffness.
- Change the structures stiffness (i.e., change column size) and observe the affect on time period.
- Run the experiment for different values of stiffness and note the time period every time
stiffness is changed.
- Check the graph between stiffness and time period.
- Again start the experiment this
initial conditions.

**Observation 3:**
- Add damping to the system (i.e., 5%) and run the experiment .
- Observe the effect of damping on time period and amplitude.
- Run the experiment for different values of
damping(etta).
- Check the graph between damping and time period.

**Observation 4:**
- Add damping to system (i.e., 5%) and run the experiment.
- Run the experiment and stop after few cycles.
- Note the values of displacement on consecutive troughs and check the value of damping by logarithmic decrement formula.
