Free vibration is initiated by disturbing the system from its static equilibrium position by imparting the mass some displacement u(0) and velocity uâ€™(0) at time t=0.<br>
There are two cases in free vibration <br>
1. undamped free vibration <br>
2. damped free vibration <br>

**Undamped free vibration :**
The governing equation for undamped free vibration is <br>

where,<br>
m = mass ,u'' = acceleration, k = stiffness, u = displacement.<br>
The solution to homogeneous equation is :<br>

where,<br>
u(0) = initial displacement ,u'(0) = initial velocity.<br>
Here in this solution we can observe that the system will vibrate only if initial displacement and/or initial velocity is given.<br>
